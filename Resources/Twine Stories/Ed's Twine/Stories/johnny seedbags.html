Here, talk to my cousin

(gargle gargle)

TALK TO DISPATCH
(ARE UNITS IN POSITION? YES)

Addiction to medicine and drugs leads to cycle of breakdown
Hunched over spine, fearless aggression...
Most are dead by the time they hit 18

YOU&#39;VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BIOFREAKS ACTUALLY ARE. THEIR MAIN JOB, THEIR MAIN CRIME, IS TO PRODUCE AND DISTRIBUTE CHEMS IN THE UNDERWORLD. EVERYTHING ELSE, THEIR ARMS MANUFACTURE, THEIR MERCENARY ACTIVITIES, IS BUILT AROUND THAT. THE TRADE IN NARCOTICS AND MEDICINE IS THE BACKBONE OF THE ORGANISATION

There&#39;s close to twelve million people living under New Babel, Constable. 

organised chaos. information goes out of dead. the organisation is like one of these poor mutant bastards - constantly melting, reforming

I&#39;ll help you. I don&#39;t want people to suffer. I want this over. I cann help.
He gives info on Freak leader, and says he&#39;ll have more if you leave him on the ground. Concerns that he might just go to ground if given opportunity, though.

at the end, minifact get on the line and ask you to advise - arrest perps now and just do a standard debrief, or leave him on the ground

Has been delivering things to Rudeboys (just cosmetic crosstalk)
