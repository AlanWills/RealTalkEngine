Narrator: It&#39;s day 8 in the villa. After last night&#39;s row, Jasper is sleeping by the pool and Isabel has a whole double bed to herself! Doesn&#39;t she look cosy?

// lights come on //

Narrator: Not any more!

Isabel: *Mmm...* Best night&#39;s sleep I&#39;ve had since I got here. I wish they wouldn&#39;t wake us up so suddenly, though.

Leon: Good for you. I spent the whole night with Serena&#39;s elbow digging into my back.

Serena: Well it&#39;s not my fault that you take up the entire bed. And at least I don&#39;t snore.

Leon: I don&#39;t snore either!

Isabel and Serena: Yes you do.

Leon: Whatever. These beds are too small. I wonder how Jasper coped on the sofa?

Leon: Maybe you should share with Iz instead, Serena.

Serena: Ooh, that sounds fun. Would it make you jealous?

Leon: ...

Serena: He&#39;s got nothing to say! Hilarious.

Leon: Quiet, you. Seriously though, do you think it&#39;s a no-go with Jasper?

Isabel: Yeah, he&#39;s completely not for me. There&#39;s just nothing there at all.

Leon: Well, I guess that means you&#39;re on the market.

Serena: Steady on, cowboy. It&#39;s only day 8. Nothing&#39;s set in stone yet.

Leon: What, really? Shit. I wonder if I can get a refund on the ring I bought...

It&#39;s day 8 in the villa. Isabel, the player character, is coupled up with Jasper. Last night they had a nasty row, and Jasper spent the night sleeping on a sofa. 

There are currently more guys than girls on the island (six guys, five girls) so the men are a bit nervous

Characters:
Isabel: The player character. Partnered up with Jasper, but not for much longer

Jasper: Posh, handsome, dark. Like a young, fit Jay Rayner. Partnered up with Isabel

Leon: A chill dude with a surfer physique. Coupled up with Serena

Serena: Energetic Italian woman with thick dark hair. Coupled up with Leon

Cesare: Passionate guy with Pogba haircut

Gil: Quiet, slightly shy guy. Currently the only person on the island without a partner

Isabel: I agree. All we&#39;re doing is wearing one another out.

Jasper: Exactly. Still, that doesn&#39;t mean we have to spend the next six weeks at one another&#39;s throats. Still friends?

Isabel: Sure. Still friends.

*Jasper flicks his hair out of his eyes.*

--If his affinity is low:
Jasper: I absolutely agree. This arrangement clearly isn&#39;t working for either of us. Better to put it out of its misery.

Isabel: You make it sound like we&#39;re some kind of sick animal.

Jasper: I&#39;m sorry. I grew up around racehorses. One picks up these figures of speech.

Isabel: Wow, so that&#39;s that. Just like that - it&#39;s over.

Jasper: That&#39;s the ordinary form of breakups. It&#39;s better to treat it like pulling off a bandage.
